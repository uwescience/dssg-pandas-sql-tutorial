## Concepts
* What is jupyterhub/jupyterlab and how is it used with conda and python to setup a computational environment
* How do we organize and analyze tabular data with software such as SQL, pandas
* Spatial attributes (such as points, lines, and polygons) in tabular data permits unique analysis with geopandas

## Skills
* Create a computational environment with conda
* Perform basic data loading, manipulation, and visualization in a jupyter notebook with python packages
* Learn basic SQL syntax for database querying, understand reasons to use SQL instead of other storage formats like .csv files
